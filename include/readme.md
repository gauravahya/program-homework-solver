1] poly.h

1. For a data set of say 5 tuples, there will be 5 Basis polynomials, each basis polynomial

will be a summation of 4 terms

2.  A basis polynomial looks like => (x-2)/3 + (x-4)/4 + (x-8)/21 + (x-10)/54

3.  "poly" class is used to represent this single polynomial.

4.  A vector ```<string>``` holds the numerators => {"x-2","x-4","x-8","x-10"} and a vector ```<int>``` holds the denominators => {3,4,21,54}

It is just used as a data type, the operations using this type is given in the ```BasisPolynomial.h```

  
2] BasisPolynomial.h

1. what this class does is it takes the x values as input in the constructor and then returns all the basis polynomials in the as a vector<poly>

  
3] LagrangePolynomial.h

1. The lagrange polynomial is the main function that generates the series

2. It is expressed as sum_of(y[i] * basis_polynomial[i])

3. A single element of the lagrange polynomial looks like => 5 * ((x-2)(x+3)(x-6)/23)

4. So a struct element is declared that represents the element

```{int multiple; vector ``` \<string> ```polynomials; int denominator}```

  

5.  And the get_lagrange_polynomials returns a vector<element> that represents the summation

4] CodeGenerator.h

1.  It takes the vector ```<element>``` as a constructor input and generates a string compatible with all the programming languages.

2.vector ```<element>``` looks like 
 ```
 {  
	{4, {"x-3","x-4","x-5"} ,3}
	{13, {"x-4","x-2","x-7"}, 4},
	{3, {"x-6","x-1","x-9"}, 7}
}
```
3.The code generator converts that into something like:

``` ((4*(x-3)*(x-4)*(x-5))/3)+((13*(x-4)*(x-2)*(x-7))/4)+((3*(x-6)*(x-1)*(x-9))/7)```

4.And then use the boilerplate code and that function to generate the source code in
*c*  *cpp*  *python*  *js*  *go*  *java*

The code of these header files is in src/folder
